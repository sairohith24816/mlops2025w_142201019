### How to Run

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `src` directory:
	```powershell
	cd assignments/assignment_2/src
	```

2. Run the calculator script and provide user input:
	```powershell
	python calculator.py
	```
	You will be prompted to enter two numbers. The script will validate the input and display the sum.

3. Run utility functions (for example, type checking):
	```powershell
	python utils.py
	```
	You can modify `utils.py` to test or demonstrate its functions with your own input.

#### Example (calculator.py):
```
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 7
Sum: 12
```

Make sure Python is installed on your system.
